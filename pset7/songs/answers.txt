1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
how would you characterize their audio aura?

To characterize the listener's aura I would calculated the average
energy, valence and danceability across all songs in the db.
If the avg are high or close to 1, listener's are the same.
If the values are low, they are oposite.

Based on the data, energy avg is 0.659, valence is 0.484 and
danceability is 0.716.

Quere SQL:
SELECT
    AVG(energy) AS avg_energy,
    AVG(valence) AS avg_valence,
    AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM songs;

This suggest a musical preference that is moderately energetic and
very dancable, but with a somewhat neytra to slightly melancholic
emotinal tone.

GPT helped me described as "moody and rhythmic" or "introspective
but driven".

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might
not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of
calculating this aura would you propose?

A loot of stuff is problematic...
- Had reduced emotinal complexity on 3 numbers;
    - Also, missing on lyrics, genres, season of the year etc;
- All songs has value 1. Even if listened once or hundreds of times;
- The features is algorithm calculated. Without careing abour how
listeners actually feels about the songs.

Some improvments...
- Add a play count;
- Segmenting by time and season;
- Including genre, lyrics, lyrics sentiment;
- Using clustering to identify distinct mood patterns.
